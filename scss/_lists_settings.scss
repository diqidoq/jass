/* --- Lists
  JASS considers anything which would listable in a text document also as lists in HTML.
  This is recommended to make HTML pages readable with CSS and JS disabled.
  JASS recommends to use lists for navs, tabs, contextual links, news grids, galleries, you name it.
  This is why JASS has no navigation component. It is added here under lists.

  To create a Bootstrap like nav it requires list classes like style-none inline and display classes like pos-fixed-top
