JASS: A simple utility first type of "describe your style as class" CSS framework with no stylesheet editing and no recompiling for new themes in mind. Development started in 2012 formerly named QCSS. Refactored in 2023 and renamed to JASS. Being cross browser compatible down to 2009 while using SASS (SCSS) for the generator (not required by default). 

An easy out-of-the-box styling layer from the bottom up by using a creative class group naming approach, easy to learn and to reuse for each project, with a footprint of only 60kb by default settings.

Supported class naming components:

 - borders (width, radius, directions)
 - colors (extensive websafe color codes)
 - responsive layouts (without flex and grid to be accessible all over the workd)
 - shadows
 - spacing tools (choose your rythm)
 - typography (most extensive typo classes available in web)
 - tools (anything needed in combination with other components like floats, positions, order, etc.)
 - optional override-switch per component (!important), default: no. (off)
 - optional child target setting per component (classes with trailing --c), default: no. (off)
 - optional print style setting per component (classes with trailing --p), default: no. (off)

> [!NOTE]
> Great to see that the margin/padding altering extension classes (e.g. mr1, pr2) based on the grid space have found its way into **Bootstrap v4 and v5**. And great to see that a CSS framework like **tailwindcss** has taken over this utility first approach here into a fully-fledged CSS framework in 2017. Just would have been nice to credit it all somewhere. I published this qcss idea in 2012. :) Without maintaining it carefully enough. So it's OK ;-)

Development status
------------------
In the first time it was more something like _"public available, but rather for own use created project"_. Lately I started to make it more production ready _"for all of us"_. The reason therefor is the growing interest out htere. Which surprised me.

None.

Optional requirements
---------------------
If you do not want to use the prebuild CSS or need to change some of the settings we provide per default, you can recompile with SCSS (SASS). All you need to do is to edit the jass.scss file. Make sure you use latest SASS with most of the additional modules so that arrays, lists, conditions etc. work well. https://sass-lang.com/install

How to use. And why JASS?
-------------------------

 > Stop learning Frameworks. Stop  hacking styles. Start building web apps.

As one of the very first with this attempt: In JASS every CSS class is just a combination of a main group identifier describing the css property with an optional direction followed by a positive or negative (-) value. Each class exist as shorthand and as most readable version, corresponding directly to the CSS property at target. There are no classes misused as label groups like for "nav" or like "primary" or "right", "xxl" etc. Only CSS-property-describing classes plus values which you use to build your style on the HTML element. 

Examples:

    b = border, m = margin, p = padding, r = radius, s = shadow, w = width, h = height
    <div class="b1 solid m20 pt10 s-2-2-8-333"> works exactly the same like <div class="border1 border-style-solid margin20 paddingtop10 shadow-2-2-8-333">

Which corresponds to CSS like: margin: 20px; padding-top: 10px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #333.

All classes are expandable by useful increasing or decreasing values defined in the settings and which can be changed for the own most common values or own rythm in mind. But keep it Jazzy! ;-)

And why JASS?

Think twice before you decide on what Web is good for and how much time you want to invest. And how many dependencies you can manage over the years. Stop building development stacks and go back to the basics. Write smart HTML with understandable classes or their shorthands to exactly know what you do and how to change it while keep being on the HTML side. Make your work independend from nested dependencies which will break in a unknown future. Use the HTML class attribute what it is made for. Or better sad: what it is intended for today. And use it much, and right. 

While classes usually have been intended to be what the name suggests: classes (groups), the simple grouping of similar styled elements turned out to become limited for modern and complex mobile web. A class name like _headers_ do not tell enough today. And there can be very different _headers_ reacting different on narrowed mobile devices. You also have to go back to the headers section of your CSS to know what styles you do have used for it and to check of other things which have caused the unwanted look. 

That's why classes became more and more cluttered and confusing "labels". And frameworks started to misuse it and the nesting of html elements in combination of classes made the HTML almost unreadable. Today, classes should still be used what they are made for. But in an extended manner. Not to group such like _headers_ or colors like "primary" but such like _styles_. Or colors like .cf65 (#FF6655). And voila you get a _header_ like this `<header class="fontsize12 border1 margin10 hmax250 color687"></header>` or in short `<header class="fsz12 b1 m1 hmax250 c687"></header>` and you will know by reading the HTML that it has a font size of 12px and a border of 1px, a margin of 10px and a max-height of 250px and a websafe color for text and shadows like #668877.

JASS keeps its concept independed from any other framework and avoids to make you depending on following JASS development. It is a ready to go and forget solution. And can perfectly get integrated into other concepts because of its smart $override variable creating component divided sheets with !important automatically for you, if you want it (disabled by default). And you can do the so called "sliding" changes rapidly by changing numbers in classes. Without revamping the whole LESS/SASS stack or other concepts which need many additional concept overthinking while editing. 

Big frameworks behaving like app-suites by creating (doubtless helpful) additonal layers, but all have the one big disadvantage that they suffer from: the ability to keep up consistency and colligation when making direct minimalist changes in a little corner of a project or when "unchaining" of style groups is needed. JASS uses a simple but smart class group concept (as one of the first in the web!) ;-). Easy to remember (after some working with it). And simple to define. And you always know what comes from where and can be re-generated in the way you like it.

As I have often stated *"Do not put more on the table than you can eat."* or *"Don't chain longer than you'll be able to survey."*

Read stories like [this](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/) to undestand what minimalists like me and low level enthusiasts like emacs and vim users come from and why they often take up position against overblown and grown hogs, too long chains of depending software and non CoC designed code.

JASS partly uses the KISS and CoC principle in the way that you only alter the overall look in the grouped css, while you alter the affecting parts the good old way: by only changing the regarding classes in html.

Inspired by the low level enthusiasts, the prior goal was to keep the creating, editing and after all the altering of the look of an html output as minimlistic and independend from any other "tools" as possible (chime in, change a nitpick and go) without losing too much of the advantages of all these fancy "tools" out there, triggered by the experience that many of the new fancy web development stuff becomes old very soon or changes their concept very often and keeps web dev teams always hussling with them rendering their advantages obsolete again.

What JASS tries to avoid
------------------------

### Short
**No** Javascript, **No** SVG support, **No** custom CSS --variables, **No** display:grid or flex, **No** ignorance against users of old browsers out there.

### Long
JASS will try to keep full cross browser compatibility including IE 8 / 9 and below and will provide CSS alternative solutions for common Javascript parts (like mobile nav, popup, etc.). Yes, you read right. There are pure people out there, please beware this. And there are still people out there disabling Javascript. And all you fighters against Browser flaws: There is no need to fight old browsers no more by pushing modern technologies. Because all modern browsers follow new technologies already. And this is great! I love all the new and often better possibilities of modern browsers. But there are browsers out there not developed no more but still used in pure corners of the world and I am not willing to ignore them. You care about accessibility? Then you should worry about those too. Just for an example: For me 1% or 2% of the world is still too much to ignore: Go and read [CAN I USE "flex"](https://caniuse.com/?search=flex)

1. Why JASS do not use Javascript? A CSS(!) framework should not use Javascript. Period. It uses smart CSS only solutions for the common Javasript parts like popups or other hidden/toggle features by using hidden checkboxes. Same goes for animations which can be perfectly integrated with Animate.css - And while this is not supported by old browser it is not mandatory to make JASS work. And since JASS is component based you are free to disable them and use other JS based tools instead.
2. JASS tries to be backwards compatible as much as possible. Again: We should not forget that not all people in the world have access to the latest and most modern browsers and powerful laptops or smartphones. That means that we carefully check the _CAN I USE_ sites and if there is too much red, we try avoiding it or only use it in not mandatory corners without breaking if not supported.
3. So, that means, SVG (as much as I like it personally a lot and work with it a lot) will not be used or linked to in JASS. Of course you are free to use it with it in your modified package.
4. JASS do not use custom CSS properties (--var). For us it is absolutely NOT understandable why using such not backwards compatible feature when a CSS framework has been compiled by preprocessors, which have been made exactly for that purpose?
5. And last but not least a maybe shocking news for you: Out of the box JASS provides only websafe 3digit hex color code classes without opacity. You may say: _"Oh how can I have all the wonderful shaded color tunes I usually use then? This reads old fashioned."_ Well, let me tell you as somebody who works as a photographer, as a cinematographer, as a colorist and often even as a designer in the most modern scenarios: They tricked you. The new toys just make you lazy. Think one more time: how many colors and shades of them do you have in mind in that moment? And are you sure that you need transparency to blend them against the background? Really? Did you know that transparency makes scrolling very CPU hungry? Do you know how many colors you can generate from just 3 digits in 16 steps (0-F) variations? From #000 to #FFF? Well check out our websafecolor generator included in this package and you will be surprised. It is OVER 4000(!) color shades. And if you are not able to use them right to create the same effects which you solve today by using rgba, well, ... then maybe _it is not the tool, but the user_. And web safe colors garantee you the most compatibility and same look on all screens. Beware: the big impressive painters of the last centuries had only 10-50 colors they have produced from flowers and spice etc. You know have over 4000!
